# Set up a Docker organization


An organization groups members and teams under one namespace and one
subscription. Anyone with a [Docker ID](/accounts/) can
create an organization or convert an individual account into one.

You start by creating a new organization or converting an individual
account. After creating or converting, you can onboard your organization.

## Names versus namespaces

When you create an organization, you set two values:

- Organization namespace is the permanent, unique identifier for your
  organization. It becomes the first part of every image name you push, as
  in `namespace/image:tag`. You can't change it after you create the
  organization.
  - Docker IDs and organization namespaces must be unique.
  - If a Docker ID is `acme`, no organization can use `acme` as its
    namespace.
- Organization name is the display name shown on your organization's
  Docker profile. You can change it at any time. See
  [Change organization information](/accounts/organization/manage/general-settings/).

## Choose how to set up

The difference between creating and converting is what happens to your
existing repositories.

- Create an organization: Choose a new namespace. Your existing
  repositories stay under your personal Docker ID.
- Convert your account: Your Docker ID becomes the organization’s
  namespace. Your repositories and image names stay the same, so anyone
  pulling your images can keep using their existing image references.
